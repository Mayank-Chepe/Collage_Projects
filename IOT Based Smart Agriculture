# 🌱 IoT-Based Smart Agriculture System – Arduino Uno Project

This is a **college-level Arduino IoT project** designed to monitor 🌡️ **temperature**, 💧 **humidity**, and 🌿 **soil moisture**.  
It uses a **DHT11 sensor** for temperature & humidity, and an **analog soil moisture sensor** to determine the soil’s water level, printing **real-time readings** via the Serial Monitor and giving **alerts** for irrigation needs.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Reads **temperature**, **humidity**, and **soil moisture**.
- 🔄 Converts soil moisture sensor values into **percentage** (0–100%).
- ⚠️ Alerts when:
  - Soil is **too dry** (< 30%)
  - Soil is **too wet** (> 80%)
  - Soil moisture is **optimal** otherwise
- ⏱ Updates readings every **5 seconds** via Serial Monitor.
- 🛠 Simple & beginner-friendly — perfect for **IoT, electronics, or agriculture projects**.

## 🔧 Hardware Required

- Arduino Uno board 💻
- DHT11 (or DHT22) Temperature & Humidity Sensor 🌡️
- Soil Moisture Sensor 🌱
- Breadboard & jumper wires 🔌
- USB cable ⚡

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. **Temperature & Humidity** are read from the DHT sensor connected to **digital pin D2**.  
2. **Soil moisture** is measured via the analog soil moisture sensor on **A0**, mapped to a **percentage scale**.  
3. Based on the soil moisture percentage:
   - `< 30%` → 🚨 **Too dry** → irrigation needed
   - `30% – 80%` → ✅ **Optimal**
   - `> 80%` → 🌊 **Too wet**
4. All results are printed on the **Serial Monitor** every **5 seconds**.

## 📊 Soil Moisture Alerts

| Moisture % | Status          | Action                      |
|------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| `< 30%`    | Too Dry 🚨      | Irrigate plants immediately |
| 30–80%     | Optimal ✅      | No action needed            |
| `> 80%`    | Too Wet 🌊      | Improve drainage            |
